# CPP (coding platform project)
This is one day project I did out of curiosity. But you can use it and extend it for coding competition as well design is pretty simple and code is very much minimal. Though I just made it for user who want to practice.
There is a file call addquestion.html as name suggest it basically add question of your portal. This thing creates html page dynamically so malicious user can always inject a JavaScript in this so you have to modify it.
Moreover there is one more thing need to be taken care of is that user don’t enter the system commands in his code. Though you can prevent this by simply modifying function inside gcc compiler.
As of now I don’t have any plan of modifying it in near future. But here are few ideas I was thinking to implement.
To Do:
[1] Sandbox to restrict user code from doing malicious activities.
[2] CERR shows the actual file name that has to be and proper formatting to be added.
